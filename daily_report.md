## Top 3 Actionable Recommendations

1. **BUY: PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk (BMRI) - Target: Rp5,200**
   - Rationale: Massive foreign inflow (Rp649 billion in single day) signals institutional confidence. Banking sector positioned to benefit from expected rate cuts in H1 2026. Window dressing momentum should support blue-chip banks through year-end. Technical setup shows breakout potential above resistance.

2. **BUY: PT GoTo Gojek Tokopedia Tbk (GOTO) - Target: Rp75-80**
   - Rationale: Historic turnaround to profitability with adjusted pre-tax profit in Q3 2025. Management raised full-year guidance significantly (Rp1.8-1.9T vs Rp1.4-1.6T). Multiple brokerages upgraded to "Buy" with target prices of Rp70-100. Strong operational leverage as losses narrow while gross profit expands 24.5% YoY.

3. **ACCUMULATE: PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk (BBNI) - Target: Rp5,800-6,000**
   - Rationale: Best-in-class efficiency metrics (CIR 46.1% vs peers at 48-49%) provide profitability cushion. DPK surging 21.4% YoY demonstrates strong franchise. Trading at below historical average valuation. CGS International highlights as fastest rebound candidate among big banks. Credit growth solid at 10.5% YoY with improving asset quality.
